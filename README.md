![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=page.id)

I am a full-stack software engineer and writer. I love programming, writing, speaking and traveling.

As a software engineer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things that change the world. That's why I like to make things that make a difference.
